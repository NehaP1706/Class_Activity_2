## EAGLE EYE TEST: CORRECTIONS

1. Added colon on line 1 and line 10 : Function definitions always end with a colon to deine scope.
2. Changed == to = on line 3 and line 4: To assign values to a variable we use an assignment operator '=' and not a relational operator such as '=='
3. Changed *** to ** on line 6: Since the procedure involves raising each digit to the power of the number of digits in the number, we use ** instead of *** to make exponentiation.
4. Changed (start end) to (start, end) on line 10: Since we are passing two arguements to the function, they must be comma separated in order to define two separate quantities.
5. Added colon on line 12 and line 13: A for loop when used with 'range' keyword, ends with a ':'. Similarly the if condition ends with ':'.
6. Changed 'is_narcissistic' to 'is_narc' on line 13: This is a function call fix to invoke the correct function.
7. Changed 'print_narc_numbers' to 'print_narcis_numbers' on line 16: This is a function call fix to invoke the correct function.

Totally, there were 10 errors in the .py file.
